The hydraulic conductivity fields used in "Manufactured_Solutions", for both 1D and 2D cases, are computed with the
Kraichnan randomization method for fixed mean hydraulic conductivity K_MEAN=15 m/day, increasing variances "varK" 
of the lnK field, and numerical coefficients consisting of a fixed realization of the set of wavenumbers and phases.
The latter, are generated for Nmod=10000 random periodic modes and stored as text files in the folders "coeffExp" and
"coeffGauss".


NOTE:
The codes "coeffExp.c" and "coeffGauss.c" use
#include<random> /* C++ library for random generated numbers */
and have to be compiled with a "-std" option, e.g.

code_name.c -std=gnu++11
